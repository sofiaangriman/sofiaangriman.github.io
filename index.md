I am a physicist with a strong background in <ins>fluid dynamics</ins>, especially in <ins>turbulence</ins>.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Physics of Fluids department](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/people/profile/1939) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, working in collaboration with [Sander G. Huisman](https://shuisman.com/) and [Detlef Lohse](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/people/profile/3).
I am interested in the <b>melting dynamics of ice</b> in different scenarios, looking into the effect of neighboring melting ice bodies, and the effect of an oscillatory flow on the melting. The approach is through idealized scenarios, with the goal of unraveling the fundamental physical mechanisms involved in the problem. I am using the [AFiD-MuRPhFi code](https://chowland.github.io/AFiD-MuRPhFi/), which models the solid-liquid transition with the phase-field method. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the [Physics department](https://df.uba.ar) of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina), where I also obtained my degree (<em>licenciatura</em>), also in physics.
During my Ph.D. I worked under the supervision of [Pablo Cobelli](http://users.df.uba.ar/cobelli/) and [Pablo Mininni](https://wp.df.uba.ar/mininni/) in the Fluids and Plasma group ([FLiP](http://wp.df.uba.ar/flip/)) at the Physics Department of the University of Buenos Aires.
My research focused mostly on <b>particle dynamics in turbulent flows</b>, where I conducted experiments in a turbulent von Kármán swirling flow, set up in the lab in Buenos Aires as part of my master's assignment.
The main problems I got interested in include the study of velocity and acceleration statistics of particles, using data extracted from their trajectories as proxies for properties of the carrier flow (such as the mean flow helicity), and studying clustering of inertial and finite size particles and how these are linked to the underlying flow properties. I also carried out Direct Numerical Simulations using the [GHOST code](https://github.com/pmininni/GHOST) to compare with the experiments.

I am part of the editorial board of [Physical Review Fluids](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/staff) as an Early Career Board Member, where I am responsible for outreach activites of the journal on social media.\
I am also involved in the organising committe of the monthly [PRFluids Journal Club](https://journals.aps.org/journal-club), along with Daphné Lemasquerier (St. Andrews), Lin Fu (HKUST) and Georgios Rigas (Imperial). We organise monthly live discussions with authors about recent publications in the journal.\
