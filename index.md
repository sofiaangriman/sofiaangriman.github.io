I am a physicist with a strong background in <ins>fluid dynamics</ins>, especially in <ins>turbulence</ins>.

I obtained my degree (<em>licenciatura</em>) in Physics from the [Physics department](https://df.uba.ar) of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina).
In April 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics, also from the University of Buenos Aires.

During my Ph.D. I worked under the supervision of [Pablo Cobelli](http://users.df.uba.ar/cobelli/) and [Pablo Mininni](https://wp.df.uba.ar/mininni/) in the Fluids and Plasma group ([FLiP](http://wp.df.uba.ar/flip/)) at the Physics Department of the University of Buenos Aires.
My research focused mostly on <b>particle dynamics in turbulent flows</b>: I conducted experiments in a turbulent von Kármán swirling flow, set up in the lab in Buenos Aires as part of my master's assignment, using mostly particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques. I also carried out Direct Numerical Simulations using the [GHOST code](https://github.com/pmininni/GHOST) to compare with the experiments.

Since May 2023 I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Physics of Fluids department](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/people/profile/1939) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I am working in collaboration with [Sander G. Huisman](https://shuisman.com/) and [Detlef Lohse](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/people/profile/3).  My current research involves studying the <b>melting of ice under different flow conditions</b>, performing numerical simulations of idealized configurations to understand the underlying physics involved in the melting process. I am using the [AFiD-MuRPhFi code](https://chowland.github.io/AFiD-MuRPhFi/), which models the solid-liquid transition with the phase-field method.
